It's Tremor Christ

Winded is the sailor when drifting by the storm
Wounded is the organ he left all bloodied on the shore
Gorgeous was his savior, sees her, drowning in his wake
Forever taste the salt of her tears, but it can't change fate
Little secrets, tremors, turned to quake
The smallest oceans still get big, big waves

Handsome is the devil, when whispering pleasing words
Triumphant are the angels if they can get there first
Little secrets, tremors, turned to quake
The smallest ocean still gets big, big waves

I'll decide, take my side
Take my time, not my life
Wait for signs, believe in lies
To get by, it's divine, whoa
You know what it's like

Turns the bow back, flows, and drops the line
Puts his faith in love and tremor Christ
