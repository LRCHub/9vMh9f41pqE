Winded is the sailor
drifting by the storm
Wounded is the organ he left all
bloodied on the shore
Gorgeous was his savior sees her
drowning in his wake
Daily taste the salt of her tear
but a chance blamed fate
Little secrets, tremors
turned to quake
The smallest oceansstill get big
big waves
<♪>
Ransom paid the Devil
He whispers pleasing words
Triumphant are the angels
if they can a get there first
Little secrets tremors
turned to quake
The smallest oceans
still get big, big waves
<♪>
I'll decide take the dive
Take my time not my life
Wait for signs .believe in lies
To get by it's divine whoa
Oh, you know what it's like
Turns the bow back
tows and drops the line
Puts his faith and love in
Tremor Christ
