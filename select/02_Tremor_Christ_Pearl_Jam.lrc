[00:27.17] Winded is the sailor
[00:32.97] Drifting by the storm
[00:39.13] Wounded is the organ

[00:52.13] Gorgeous was his saviour, sees her
[00:58.10] Drowning in his wake

[03:33.26] Oh you know what it's like
[03:46.26] 
[03:43.31] Turns the bow back, tows and
[03:49.47] Drops the line
[03:55.63] Puts his faith in love and tremor christ
